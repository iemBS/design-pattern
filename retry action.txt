Retry Action
Pre-Condition:
  -"Define Failure Reason"
  -"Determine Max Retry Count"
  -"Determine Wait Duration"
Main Success Scenario:
  1. "Wait"
  2. "Check Conditions"
  3. Retry action
  4. Action successful
  5. End 
Alternatives:
  2a. Failed for a Non-Retryable reason
    2a1. Go to step 5
  4a. Action not successful
    4a1. Go to step 1
    
    
Define Failure Reason
Main Success Scenario:
  1. "Define Retryable Failure Reason"
  2. End 
Alternatives:
  1a. Cannot be retried
    1a1. "Define Non-Retryable Failure Reason"
    1a2. Go to step 2
    

Define Retryable Failure Reason
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Retryable Failure Reasons
    -Cannot connect, destination too busy
    -Can connect, but destination too busy
    -Can connect, destination NOT busy, response not desirable, response should only be temporary
    -xxx:fill in 
  

Define Non-Retryable Failure Reason
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Non-Retryable Failure Reasons
    -Cannot connect, destination is down
    -Can connect, destination NOT busy, response not desirable, response is not temporary
    -xxx:fill in 
    
Check Failure Reason
Pre-Conditions:
  -"Define Failure Reason"
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Can be surpassed with a retry (in Possible Retryable Failure Reasons)
  2. End 
Alternatives:
  1a. Cannot be surpassed with a retry 
    1a1. in Possible Non-Retryable Failure Reasons
    1a2. go to step 2
  1b. Not sure if can be surpassed (not in Possible or Non-Possible Retryable Failure Reasons)
    1b1. Log details 
    1b2. Go to step 1
  1c. Cannot be surpassed with a retry and retries exhausted
    1c1. Use logged details of failure to add it to the Possible or Non-Possible Retryable list
    1c2. Watch action next time
    1c3. Go to step 2
    
    
    
Check Conditions
Main Success Scenario:
  1. "Check Failure Reason"
  2. End 


Wait
Main Success Scenario:
  1. xxx:fill in 


Determine Max Retry Count
Main Success Scenario: 
  1. xxx:fill in
  
  
Determine Wait Duration
Main Success Scenario: 
  1. "Determine Wait Dependencies"
  2. "Determine Wait Type"
  3. "Determine Retry count impact on Wait Duration"
  

Determine Wait Type
Main Success Scenario: 
  1. Loop until conditions are good enough to retry
  2. End 
Alternatives:
  1a. Hand of the component that will perform the action in a stopped state to a manager component that does the waiting and the awakening
    1a1. xxx:fill in 
  
  
Determine Retry count impact on Wait Duration
Main Success Scenario: 
  1. Have same wait duration before each retry
  2. End 
Alternatives:
  1a. Have longer wait time before each retry
    1a1. Wait twice as long as previous wait
    1a2. Go to step 2
  
  
Determine Wait Dependencies
Main Success Scenario: 
  1. Determine how much time should pass until action likely to succeed
  x. xxx:fill in
