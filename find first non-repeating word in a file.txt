  - File is 100 GB
  - File can be traversed only once
  - Each node keeps a repeated words list

Main Success Scenario:
  1. Split file across N nodes in a Hadoop environment. 
  2. Each node skips words in repeated words list. 
  3. Each node adds words to non-repeated words list. 
  4. Each node removes from non-repeated words list if found in repeated words list.
