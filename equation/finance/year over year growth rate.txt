Get Year over Year Growth Rate
Preconditions:
  - yA = later year value
  - yB = earlier year value
  - YoY = YoY Growth Rate
  - yA and yB have same time units (day, week, month, quarter, year, etc)
Main Success Scenario: 
  1. Calculate YoY = (yA - yB) / yB
  2. positive, non-zero, non-null YoY
Alternatives: 
  2a. yA is much greater than yB
    2a1. makes YoY very large 
    2a2. choose max YoY value to show
  2b. yA is null
    2b1. show YoY as null
  2c. yB is null
    2c1. show YoY as null
  2d. yA is negative and makes YoY very large
    2d1. choose max -YoY value to show
  2e. yB is negative and makes YoY very large
    2e1. choose max YoY value to show
