Get Gross Profit Margin
Preconditions: 
  - gpm = gross profit margin
  - r = revenue
  - c = cost of goods sold
  - r & c may be in 100s, 1000s, millions or billions to reduce the size of the numbers. 
  - r and c exist for the same time units (day, week, month, quarter, year, etc)
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Calculate gpm = (r â€“ c)/r
  2. positive, non-zero value for gpm
Alternatives: 
  2a. gpm is negative
    2a1. indicates that revenue has not yet exceeded cost
    2a2. choose to show a negative or zero gpm
  2b. gpm is zero
    2b1. indicates that revenue equals cost
  2c. r is zero
    2c1. do not calculate gpm 
    2c2. choose to show gpm as zero or -100
  2d. r is null (data not provided)
    2d1. do not calculate gpm
    2d2. choose to show gpm as null
  2e. c is null (not provided)
    2e1. do not calculate gpm
    2e2. choose to show gpm as null
