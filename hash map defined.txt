/*
a hash table (hash map) is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, 
a structure that can map keys to values. A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, 
from which the desired value can be found. 
*/

Define a Hash Table (Hash Map)
Preconditions:
  - Hash Table in memory
  - Each key in hash table is unique 
  - Duplicate key cannot be inserted.
  - Value for each key is stored in Hash Table 
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Insert Key and Value pair into Hash table. 
  2. Hash function creates an index for each key and value pair
Alternatives:
  2a. Index generated is dependent on when key & value pair was inserted. 
    2a1. Use Linked Hash Table instead of just a Hash Table.
