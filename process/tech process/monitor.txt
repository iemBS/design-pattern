Monitor
Main Success Scenario:
  1. "Define Monitoring Goal"
  2. "Monitor from Environment Perspective"
  3. End 
Alternatives:
  2a. From Process Perspective
    2a1. "Monitor from Process Perspective"
    2a2. Go to step 3
    
 
Define Monitoring Goal
Maih Success Scenario:
  1. Check functionality during development
  2. End 
Alternatives:
  1a. during Testing 
    1a1. Check functionality during testing
    1a2. Go to step 2
  1b. during regular use
    1b1. Watch functionality during regular use
    1b2. Go to step 2
    
    
Monitor from Environment Perspective
Pre-Conditions:
  -Concerned with environment health and not a specific process
Main Success Scenario:
  1. See environment measures 
  2. See aggregate measures that are built on top of the basic ones
  3. Compare environment measures to aggregate environment measures to see if runs are better or worse than usual
  4. Communicate hard hardware and software limits
  5. Set limits for measures and aggregate measures (> aggregates, < hard limits) 
  6. Set alerts based on measures, aggregate measures, and limits  
  7. End 
    
    
Monitor from Process Perspective
Pre-Conditions:
  -Concerned with process health
Main Success Scenario:
  1. See Process Start, Stop, Duration, Run Status, Completion Status
  2. See Tasks within Process
  3. See Task Start, Stop, Duration, Run Status, Completion Status, Status (enabled/disabled)
  4. See aggregate measures that are built on top of the basic ones
  5. Compare process and task runs to aggregate measures to see if runs are better or worse than usual
  6. Associate Runs to Environment measures (at task, process, service instance, or service level)
  7. Communicate hard hardware and software limits
  8. Set limits for measures and aggregate measures (> aggregates, < hard limits) 
  9. Set alerts based on measures, aggregate measures, and limits  
  10. End
