    1a1. "Compare Graph DB Code"
    1a2. Go to step 2
  1b. xxx:fill in
    
    
Compare Relational DB Code
Note:
  -Do not compare child structures if the parent structures do not match. Doing so just has you looking at more detail for something you can more easily and already saw at a summary level. 
  -Compare existence before definition
  -Clarify if child definitions are included in parent definitions and why. 
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Compare routine existence
  2. Compare routine definition
  3. Compare table existence
  4. Compare table definition (includes column definitions)
  5. Compare column existence
  6. Compare column definition
  7. Compare column index existence
  8. Compare column index definition
  9. Compare view existence
  10. Compare view definition
  11. "Compare Static Relational DB Data"
  12. End 

  
Compare Static Relational DB Data
Note:
  -Static data can be seen as part of the code in a way. 
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Compare static table data 
  2. Compare System Variable differences 
  3. End
