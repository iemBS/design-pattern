Minimize Sprint Scope Change
Note:
  -Sprint, push, iteration, time-boxed period, and development period all refer to a period of time that is spent working on a set of items 
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Work on only items specified as in scope at the beginning of the sprint
  2. For a bug, use a temp fix
  3. At sprint start, estimate time spent deploying
  4. At sprint start, estimate time spent testing
  5. At sprint start, estimate time spent reviewing other's work
  6. End
Alternatives:
  2a. A temp fix cannot be used and items must be re-prioritized
    2a1. Re-prioritize work items
    2a2. go to step 6
  2b. A temp fix cannot be used and bug must be passed to another existing team member
    2b1. Hand bug to another existing team member
    2b2. go to step 6
  2c. A temp fix cannot be used and bug must be passed to a new team member
    2c1. Hand bug to new team member
    2c2. go to step 6
