Minimize Sprint Scope Change
Note:
  -Sprint, push, iteration, time-boxed period, and development period all refer to a period of time that is spent working on a set of items 
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Work on only items specified as in scope at the beginning of the sprint
  2. For a bug, use a temp fix
  3. End
Alternatives:
  2a. A temp fix cannot be used and items must be re-prioritized
    2a1. Re-prioritize work items
    2a2. go to step 3
  2b. A temp fix cannot be used and bug must be passed to another existing team member
    2b1. Hand bug to another existing team member
    2b2. go to step 3
  2c. A temp fix cannot be used and bug must be passed to a new team member
    2c1. Hand bug to new team member
    2c2. go to step 3
