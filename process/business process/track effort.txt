Track Effort
Note:
  -This guidance can remind you to create general items in a sprint to estimate the time that will be spent in general for areas rather than having to create and manage specific trackers for these areas.
  -A work place that is bad at providing requirements can be an indicator of if other areas are bad and general trackers need to be created to allow each person to estimate their own time spent. 
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Track specific activity effort
Alternatives:
  1a. Track General Planning Effort
      -work items need to be clarified before they can be worked on
  1b. Track General Code Review Effort
      -code review is done on another person's work
      -the other person estimated the code review effort
  1c. Track General Deploy Effort
      -deploy may be done on another person's work
      -the other person understand the work better
      -the other person provides deployment instructions
  1d. Track General Bug Triage Effort
      -bug triage may be done on another person's work
  1e. Track Bug Research (wo fix) Effort
      -Bug research is done on new bugs. Research determines if it is a bug, if it needs to be dealt with now, what team needs to fix it, and if it is a short or long term fix.
