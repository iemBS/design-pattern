Track Effort
Note:
  -This guidance can remind you to create general items in a sprint to estimate the time that will be spent in general for areas rather than having to create and manage specific trackers for these areas.
  -A work place that is bad at providing requirements can be an indicator of if other areas are bad and general trackers need to be created to allow each person to estimate their own time spent. 
  -Group Planning Tracking Item Description: To ensure a researchers time stays aligned with a sprint, this item is owned by the researcher. This is specific to tracking time spent planning. Includes prep before planning meetings and the planning meetings. 
  -General Code Tracking Item Description: To ensure a researchers time stays aligned with a sprint, this item is owned by the researcher. This is specific to tracking time spent code reviewing. 
  -General Deploy Tracking Item Description: To ensure a researchers time stays aligned with a sprint, this item is owned by the researcher. This is specific to tracking time spent deploying changes. 
  -Bug Research Tracking Item Description: To ensure a researchers time stays aligned with a sprint, this item is owned by the researcher. This is specific to tracking time spent researching bugs. Short or long term bug fixes are covered in a different item.
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Track specific activity effort
Alternatives:
  1b. Track General Code Review Effort
      -code review is done on another person's work
      -the other person estimated the code review effort
  1c. Track General Deploy Effort
      -deploy may be done on another person's work
      -the other person understand the work better
      -the other person provides deployment instructions
  1d. Track General Bug Triage Effort
      -bug triage may be done on another person's work
  1e. Track Bug Research (wo fix) Effort
      -Bug research is done on new bugs. Research determines if it is a bug, if it needs to be dealt with now, what team needs to fix it, and if it is a short or long term fix.

  1g. Track Individual Planning Effort
    -work items need to be clarified before they can be worked on
  1h. Track Group Planning Effort
    -work items need to be clarified before they can be worked on  


Track Level
Main Success Scenario:
  1. "Track at Top Level"
  2. "Track at 2nd Level"
  3. "Track at Bottom Level"
  
  
Track at Top Level
Note:
  -Meant to group items 2nd level trackers
Main Success Scenario:
  1.xxx:fill in 
  
  
Track at 2nd Level
Note:
  -Common level to track at
  -Tracking level communicated to the business
  -Singl person owns
Main Success Scenario:
  1.xxx:fill in 
  
  
Track at 3rd Level
Note:
  -If more than one person involved with working on a 2nd level item, those different people are owning 3rd level trackers here
  -Tracking level NOT communicated to the business
Main Success Scenario:
