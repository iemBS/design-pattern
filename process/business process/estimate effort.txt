-tech design review by another developer
-tech design review delay: developer reviewer not available 
-tech design review delay: permission needed
-tech design review delay: lack of requirements 
-redesign

-coding delay: find bug that CANNOT be worked around
-coding delay: do not understand technology being used
-coding delay: do not understand coding language being used 
-coding delay: do not understnad coding library being used
-coding delay: waiting for a process to start and stop
-coding delay: other item being tested in same area
-coding delay: other item being tested in same area
-coding delay: other item being developed in same area
-coding delay: insufficient tech design 
-test by developer, 1 or more iterations 
-test by developer delay: multiple testers and items on same area
-re-coding, 1 or more iterations 
-learn new tech
-learn new tech delay: permission needed

-hardware resource delay: performance limit reached
-hardware resource delay: performance limit reached with shared hardware resource
-hardware resource delay: waiting for a process to start and stop
-software resource delay: licensing limit
-software resource delay: performance limit reached with shared licensing limit
-software resource delay: waiting for a process to start and stop
-documentation
-documentation review by other person
-documentation review delay: reviewer not available 
-documentation update
-documentation provided in other perspectives 
-code review 1 or more iterations 
-code review delay: other developer not available 
-code review delay: permission needed
-code review delay: lack of requirements lead to more coding or coding that is incomplete 
-code review delay: technology discussion

-code review delay: do not understand coding language being reviewed 
-code review delay: do not understnad coding library being reviewed
-code review delay: more code to review than expected
-re-coding 1 or more iterations after code review 
-deploy prep
-deploy, 3 (at least 1 per environment) or more iterations
-deploy delay: specific deploy window required
-deploy delay: permission needed
-deploy delay: is new deploy process
-deploy delay: deploy process uses shared hardware resources
-test by tester, 1 or more iterations 
-test by tester delay: permissions needed
-test by tester delay: tester not available 
-test by tester delay: insufficient test guidance 
-test by tester delay: lack of requirements caused more coding and more coding caused more testing
-test by tester delay: Tester blocked and developer not available to research
-test by tester delay: developer needs to assist with testing 
-test by tester delay: data quality
-test by tester delay: waiting for a process to start and stop
-test by tester delay: multiple testers and items on same area
-re-coding 1 or more iterations after test by tester
-test by user
-test by user delay: permissions needed
-test by user delay: test window required
-test by user delay: user not available 
-test by user delay: insufficient test guidance 
-test by user delay: user blocked and tester and developer are not available 
-test by user delay: lack of requirements leads to less than desirable result that is tested by the user
-test by user delay: waiting for a process to start and stop
-test by user delay: multiple testers and items on same area
-re-coding 1 or more iterations after test by user
-general delay: orders from two or more managers
-general delay: unclear project priorities 
-general delay: jumping between multiple work items
-general delay: recalibration when jumping between multiple work items
-general delay: time spent on another project
-general delay: too much time spent in meetings
-next sprint prep (factoring in all of the above for each item)


Base Estiamte on Previous Work
Main Success Scenario:
  1. xxx:fill in 
  
  
Estimate Numerous Small Activities as Categories
Main Success Scenario:
  1. "Review Others Work"
  2. "Deploy Others Work"
  3. "Research Potential Bug"
  
  
Review Others Work
Main Success Scenario:
  1. "Review Others Docs"
  2. End 
Alternatives:
  1a. Review code instead 
    1a1. "Review Others Code" 
    1a2. go to step 2
  
  
Review Others Docs
Main Success Scenario:
  1. xxx:fill in 
  
  
Review Others Code
Main Success Scenario:
  1. xxx:fill in 
  

Deploy Others Work
Main Success Scenario:
  1. xxx:fill in 


Research Potential Bug
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Research potential bug
  2. Becomes a bug
  3. Determine bug needs to be fixed now
  4. Determine short term bug fix can be done now
  5. Do short term bug fix 
  6. End
Alternatives:
  2a. Does not become bug
    2a1. go to last step
