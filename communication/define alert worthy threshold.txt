Define Alert Worthy Threshold
Note:
  -Factoring in a special period could be ...
    -End of a business cycle
    -could be a long term upstream trouble
  -Factoring in a special event could be ...
    -a specific day
    -upstream trouble
    -xxx:fill in 
  -Having to factor in an event or a period, may indicate the need to be able to have a temp override
Main Success Scenario:
  1. See metric Hx
  2. See consumer response to DQ
  3. See provider data change expections 
  4. Define alert threshold that balances the above three
  5. End 
Alternatives:

    4a1. xxx:fill in 
    4a2. go to step 5
  4b. Factor in specific periods
    4b1. xxx:fill in 
    4b2. go to step 5
