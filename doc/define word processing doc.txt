Define Word Processing Doc
Note:
  -Avoid the use of internal links within the doc. The links are a fast way to jump, but you have to be mindful during updates to continue their functionality. The more people working on a doc, the more likely those internal links will be broken. Just reference unique IDs or names of sections. 
Main Success Scenario:

    -step down font size
    -step down behind text shading 
    -number of levels palatable by the doc audience

  -Behind text shading keeps you from relying only on the text or a ID prefix to indicate the level
  -If your doc audience sees darker color as stronger, then have the higher levels be darker
  -possible colors (in hex)
    -blue (from level 1 to level 4)
      -#1F3864
