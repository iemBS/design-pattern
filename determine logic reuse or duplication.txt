Determine Logic Reuse or Duplication
Note:
  -Reusing logic keeps one version of the logic
  -Duplicating logic will have more than one version of the logic
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Determine if reused logic can handle two or more simultaneous calls
  2. Determine if future reused logic changes will make reused logic too complex
  3. Determine if future logic changes will be performed by many or one
  4. Determine if future reused logic developers will be aware of all consumers of the reused logic
  5. Determine if reused logic is allowed to have more than one copy
  6. Determine if there can be more than one reused logic component
