Define Code Path
Main Success Scenario:
  1. xxx:fill in 
  
  
Control or Handle
Note:
  -Both are conditionals, one is at the front and one is at the end
  -Relying on error handling can cause more logging and provide less clarity on path through code
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Follow known path
  2. End
Alternatives:
  1a. Handle path taken based on conditions
    1a1. xxx:fill in 
    1a2. Go to step 2
