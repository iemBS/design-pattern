Main Success Scenario:
  1. Try blocks do not hurt code readability
  2. Error source does NOT determine how error is handled
  3. Error type does NOT determine how error is handled
  4. One specific error can occur for each possible error type
  5. Catch blocks do not hurt code readability
  6. Not many error types are handled in catch blocks
  7. Pre-Error checks reduce possible errors
  8. End 
Alternatives:
  1a. Too many Try blocks hurt readability
    1a1. Reduce number of Try blocks
    1a2. Go to step 2
  2a. Error source DOES determine how error is handled
    2a1. Put Try blocks closer to error source
    2a2. Go to step 3
  3a. Error type DOES determine how error is handled
    3a1. Replace the existing Try block with more than 1 Try block OR single Try block must have Error type specific catches OR put Try blocks closer to error source
    3a2. Go to step 4.
  4a. More than one error can occur for an error type and error provides enough info to determine which one
    4a1. Go to step 5
  4b. More than one error can occur for an error type and error provides insufficient info to determine which one
    4b1. Collect pre-error info to discern between errors 
    4b2. Replace single Try block with multiple Try blocks
    4b3. Go to step 5
  5a. Too much is being done in catch block
    5a1. Reduce Try block scope and/or put Try blocks closer to error source
    5a2. Go to step 6
  6a. Too many error types are handled in catch blocks
    6a1. Replace the existing Try block with more than 1 Try block OR put Try blocks closer to error source
    6a2. Go to step 7
