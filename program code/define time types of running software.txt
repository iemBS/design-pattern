Define Time Types of Running Software
Pre-Condition:
  -Need to understand the amount of time spent executing the software and the fetching the result, instead of just the full run time. 
Main Success Scenario:
  1. "Define Execution Time"
  2. "Define Data Fetch Time"
  3. End 
Alternatives:
  2a. Software does not return result
    2a1. Go to step 3
  
  
Define Execution Time
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Get time software starts execution
  2. No sub-component is timed
  3. Get time software stops execution
  4. Subtract second time from the first time
  5. End 
Alternatives:
  2a. Time sub-component
    2a1. Get start time of sub-component execution
    2a2. Get end time of sub-component execution 
    2a3. Go to step 2a1 for another sub-component or to step 3
  
  
Define Data Fetch Time
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Time result leaves executing software
  2. Time result reaches pre-defined output
  3. Subtract second time from the first time
