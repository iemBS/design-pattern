Identify Errable Code
Note:
  -Explicitly or implicitly thrown errors will provide an error category, error code, and a message. 
  -If the main path through the code can avoid an error with a code change, then the error was because of a bug. 
  -If an alternate path needs to exist for an error, then the error is not because of a bug and a bug fix is not possible.
  -Identifying errable code allows us to define what code blocks to have try blocks on, what catch blocks to associate to try blocks, and if it is better to have try ... catch blocks upstream or downstream in the code flow. 
Main Success Scenario:
  1. "Identify Error Classes"
  2. "Identify Allowed Code Entrances and Exits"
  3. "Understand Code Logic"
  4. "Trust What Enters"
  5. "Trust What Exits"
  6. "Test Allowed and Unexpected Scenario"
  7. "Identify Error Origin"
  8. End
  
  
Understand Code Logic
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Understand what the code is intending to do
  2. Understand what the code is doing
  3. End 
Alternatives:
  1a. Do not understand what the code is intending to do
    1a1. Go to step 1
  2a. Do not understand what the code is doing
    2a1. Go to step 2
  
  
Trust What Enters
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Same party owns code being entered and the code doing the entering
  2. End 
Alternatives:
  1a. Different parties owns code being entered and the code doing the entering
    1a2. xxx:fill in 
    1a3. Go to step 2
    

Trust What Exits
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Same party owns code being entered and the code doing the entering
  2. End 
Alternatives:
  1a. Different parties owns code being entered and the code doing the entering
    1a2. xxx:fill in 
    1a3. Go to step 2
  

Identify Error Origin
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Is an error seen in multiple code blocks inherited from one code block?
  2. Should only the source code block be errable or the downstream code blocks be errable as well?
  3. End 
  
  
Identify Allowed Code Entrances and Exits
Main Success Scenario:
  1. "Identify How Code Can Be Entered"
  2. "Identify What Can Enter the Code"
  3. "Identify How Code Can be Exited"
  4. "Identify What Can Exit the Code"
  5. End 
  
  
Identify How Code Can Be Entered
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Identify function parameter entrance
  2. Identify get class variable entrance
  3. Identify get global variable entrance
  4. Identify get property entrance
  5. Identify get child function result entrance
  6. End 
  
  
Identify What Can Enter the Code
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Identify data type of content entering via "Identify How Code Can Be Entered" entrances
  2. Identity size of content entering via "Identify How Code Can Be Entered" entrances
  3. End 
  
  
Identify How Code Can be Exited
Note:
  -Some exits are momentary because something is being passed out and then execution of code within the block continues 
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Identify function return exit
  2. Identify set class variable exit
  3. Identity set global variable exit
  4. Identify set property exit
  5. Identity send parameter to child function exit 
  6. End


Identify What Can Exit the Code
Main Success Scenario:
  1. xxx:fill in 
  2. How possible is a scenario to cause an error
  3. End 


Test Allowed and Unexpected Scenario
Main Success Scenario:
  1. xxx:fill in 
  
  
Identify Error Classes
Note:
  -In Python
    -for re module, ref @ https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.error
    -for pandas module, ref @ https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.errors.AbstractMethodError.html
    -for boto3 module, ref @ https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/error-handling.html?highlight=exception
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Identify error classes associated to classes used in your code
  2. End
