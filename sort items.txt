Sort Items w Lomuto partition scheme
Note: 
  - Known as Quick Sort
  - Guidance from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort
  - Partitioning defined as reorder array so all elements with values less than the pivot come before the pivot (low elements), 
    while all elements with values greater than the pivot come after it (high elements) (equal values can go either way). 
  - algorithm looks like this
        algorithm quicksort(A, lo, hi) is
            if lo < hi then
                p := partition(A, lo, hi)
                quicksort(A, lo, p - 1)
                quicksort(A, p + 1, hi)

        algorithm partition(A, lo, hi) is
            pivot := A[hi]
            i := lo
            for j := lo to hi - 1 do
                if A[j] < pivot then
                    swap A[i] with A[j]
                    i := i + 1
            swap A[i] with A[hi]
            return i
Preconditions:
  - Collection of items in an array
Main Success Scenario
  1. Pick an item, called a pivot, from the array.
  2. Partitioning
  3. Recursively apply steps 1 & 2 to sub-arrays
