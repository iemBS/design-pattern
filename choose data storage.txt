Main Success Scenario:
  1. Find most sensible storage type for the data's purpose and usage
  2. If using a DB, find the most sensible DB type for the data's purpose and usage


chg freq
  -chg freq in the past
  -est chg freq in future
chg time
  -max time it took to change data in past
  -est max time it will take to chg data in future
in time
  -max time it took to insert data in past
  -est max time it will take to insert data in future
in freq
  -insert freq in the past
  -est insert freq in future
  -insert static vs live/streaming
out time
  -max time it took to extract data in past
  -est max time it will take to extract data in future
out freq
  -extract freq in the past
  -est extract freq in future
compression
  -% of compression achieved within data storage
  -is data compressed during insert and uncompressed during extract
redundancy
  -is redundancy needed
     -does host provide redundancy
        -how many redundanct copies exist
        -how old are copies
        -where to copies exist (same physical disk, same server, same server farm, same building, same country)
up time
  -when we need storage to be up
  -host reliability
conn 
  -rate
     -min conn rate from each geo that will insert, update, & extract data
     -max conn rate from each geo that will insert, update, & extract data
  -simulataneous users
     -max # simulataneous users host allows
     -max # simulataneous users reached
     -how often "max # simulataneous users host allows" is reached
     -max # simulataneous users reached per geo
query
  -quality of queries run against data storage (lower quality leads to lower performance & higher cost)
  -language intuitive for devs to use
  -canned, optimized queries available for users and devs
  -max wait time before query starts executing
  -avg wait time before query starts executing
  -calc done on the fly by users via prepped calcs before data is accessible to users
purpose
  -Purposes define if data needs to be broken up or matured into more than one data storage
data structure
  -data using most sensible structure for it's purpose and usage
env
  -Prod env exists 
     -only queries already optimized, tested, and have clear purpose in Prep env run here
  -Prep env exists
     -devs optimize, test, and define purpose for queries
  -env based on geo
stages
  -stages that data needs to go through
  -data moved during stage chg or are stages applied to non-moving data
cost
  -cost to store data in in host
  -cost to query (update, insert, extract) host
  -cost of redundancy
  -cost to backup
  -cost to monitor
  -cost up conn rate upgrade
log
  -can log query runs
  -log used to make better data storage choices

  - SQL
      Relational
  - NoSQL
    - Key-Value
      - Key-Value Cache
      - Key-Value Store
          def: 
            - use associative array / map / dictionary
            - simple data model
      - Key-Value Store (eventually-consistent)
      - Key-Value Store (Ordered)
    - Data-Structures Server
        ex: Redis
    - Tuple Store
        ex: Apache > River
    - Object
        def: 
          - data stored as objects like in object oriented programming
    - Object-Relational
        def: 
          - hybrid of relational and object DB approaches
    - Document Store
        def: 
          - use XML, YAML, JSON, or BSON encoding in doc
          - each doc has unique key
          - each doc can have it's own unique structure
        ex: MongoDB, Couchbase, CouchDB, Elasticsearch, DocumentDB
    - Wide Column Store
        def: 
          - 2-D key-value store
          - Unlike a relational DB, column names and formats can vary from row to row in same table
        ex: AWS > DynamoDB, GCP > BigTable, Apache > Cassandra, Apache > HBase
    - Wide Column Store (w column families) / Column Family DB
        def: 
          - Has column families that are stored together
    - Native Multi-Model DB
        ex: MS > Cosmos DB
    - Graph
        def: 
          - relationships also have properties
          - connection heavy
        ex: Neo4j, AWS > Neptune
        
      - Triplestore / RDF Store
          def: 
            - Purpose-built DB for storage & retrieval of triples
            - Triple = subject-predicate-object
      - Quadstore / Named Graph
          def: 
            - Purpose-built DB for storage & retrieval of quads
            - Quad = name-subject-predicate-object
      - Network
          def: 
            - Each record having one parent record and many children
            - Hierarchical database model structures data as a tree of records
    - Column
        def: 
          - Each column is stored separately on disk
          - has column families
          - column families stored seperately
        ex: Cassandra, Hbase
