Use ETL or ELT or neither
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Apply reqs early in data life cycle to filter out uneeded data (ETL)
  2. Apply reqs to connect to other data (ELT)
  3. Perform parallel processing on data (ELT) 
  4. Apply reqs to data that will be consumed by reports or downstream systems (ELT)
Alternatives:
  1a. Data pulled in has already been cleaned and sufficient transforms applied
    1a1. Use ELT instead of ETL
  1b. Virtual data reporting level points to data in storage, which greatly reduces transformations or movement between dat layers
    1b1. Use ELT instead of ETL
Extension:
  1a. Data is too dirty to use
    1a1. Apply reqs that update the data (ETL)
  1b. Data Storage is expensive
    1b1. Apply filters, updates, and aggregations to reduce cost of storage (ETL)
  1c. Compute is expensive
    1c1. Apply filters then updates to reduce cost of compute (ETL)
