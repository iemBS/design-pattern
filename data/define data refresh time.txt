Define Data Refresh Time
Pre-Conditions
  -Change time is the time data is new or updated
Note
  -A change time field may not have the same name in a downstream system, because fields are labeled from the perspective of the downstream system.
    -A source system could have UpdatedDateTime and a downstream system could rename to SourceUpdatedDateTime.
  -If source is "SystemA" and downstream source is "SystemB". That change time field in SystemB could be, SystemAchgTime and SystemBchgTime.
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Note data change time in source 
  2. Carry change time to down stream 
  3. Rename source field to identify it as coming from that source. 
  4. Note data change time in current system
  5. Add a change time to a report that is pulling data from SourceB.
