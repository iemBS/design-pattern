Improve Performance
Note:
  -Do the steps in this order
Main Success Scenario:
  1. "Tune Query"
  2. "Tune Database Object"
  3. "Scale Resource"
  4. "Throttle Resource"
  5. "Charge User for Resource Use"
Alternatives:
  2a. Tuning is not enough and the database object needs to be redesigned
    2a1. "Redesign Database Object"
  2b. Tuning is not enough, database object redesign is not enough
    2b1. "Database becomes Multiple Databases"
  2c. Tuning and database object redsign are not enough, using multiple database instead is not solution
    2c1. Go to step 4
  4a. Throttling is not an option
    3a1. Go to step 5
    
    
Tune Query
Main Success Scenario:
  1. xxx:fill in


Tune Database Object
Main Success Scenario:
  1. "Tune Table"
Alternatives:
  1a. View is used in a query
    1a1. "Tune View"
  1b. Defined relations between tables/views could be better
    1b1. "Tune Relation"
  1c. Tune not needed at table/view level
    1c1. "Tune Database"
    
    
Tune Table
Note:
  -A Table is an object in a relational database. So, this could also be a another type of object that holds records and each records has one or more fields/attributes in it.
Main Success Scenario:
  1. xxx:fill in


Tune View
Note:
  -A view is an object in a relational database. This could be a view type object for non-relational databases as well. 
Main Success Scenario:
  1. xxx:fill in


Tune Relation
Main Success Scenario:
  1. xxx:fill in


Tune Database
Main Success Scenario:
  1. xxx:fill in

       
Scale Resource
Main Success Scenario:
  1. "Scale RAM"
Alternatives:
  1a. CPU needs to be scaled
    1a2. "Scale CPU"
  1b. Disk space neesd to be scaled
    1b1. "Scale Disk Space"
  1c. Disk IO needs to be scaled
    1c1. "Scale Disk IO"


Throttle Resource
Main Success Scenario:
  1. xxx:fill in


Charge User for Resource Use
Main Success Scenario:
  1. xxx:fill in
