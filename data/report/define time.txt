Define Calculate Time
Note:
  -Calculate once and store result, reduces CPU and RAM resources
  -Calculate every time allows for past calculations to be changed
  -Having two process where process 1 calculates only new data and stores old data and process 2 allows you to re-calculate old data when needed, is the best of both worlds. 
Main Success Scenario:
  1. For new data, calculate and get new results 
  2. For past data, retrieve past calculation result
  3. Pull calculation time
  4. End 
Alternatives:
  2a. Re-calculate past data becasue of change to old data or calculation
    2a1. xxx:fill in
    2a2. Go to step 4
