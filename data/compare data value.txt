Group Values 
Note:
  -Grouping values allows a group representative to be compared rather than all the values in the group
  -If a data collection needs to be compared to a data collection elsewhere, this can reduce the movement of data to only the group representative
  -The broader the definition of the group, the more values making up the group, and the possibly the less representative the group representative will be
  -ways of grouping
    -value divergence due to 
      -pronunciation
        -speach impediment
        -accent
        -non-fluent speaker
      -sound perception
      -spelling ability
      -text format differences
      -writing ability
      -sight perception
        -human
        -machine
      -typing ability
      -language evolution
      -character set digital conversion
