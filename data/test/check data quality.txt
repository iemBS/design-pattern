Check Data Quality
Pre-Conditions
  -Run "Check SQL Object Quality" use case before this one
  -Not checking how well data was migrated or comparing upstream data to downstream data
Main Success Scenario:  
  1. "Check Data Relations"
  2. "Check for Dupes"
  3. "Check for unexpected content in values"
  4. "Check time is tracked appropriately"
  5. "Check numeric data scale"
  6. "Check data is minimized"
  7. "Check data hidden appropriately"
  
Check Data Relations
Main Success Scenario:
  x. "Understand relationship between columns within same table/frame/etc"
  x. "Understand relationship between columns within different table/frame/etc"
  x. "Check if same column name in different table has different values"
  x. "Check if different column name in different table has same values"
  x. "Check UniqueId"
  x. "Check indexing"
  
Understand relationship between columns within same table/frame/etc
Main Success Scenario:
  1. What data hierarchies exist 
  
Understand relationship between columns within different table/frame/etc
Main Success Scenario:
  1. What data hierarchies exist 

Check numeric data scale
Note:
  -Precision is the total count of digits allowed in the number
  -Scale is how small the units go. 
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Time is down to the appropriate time unit now and for the future
  2. Numbers with digits to the right of the decimal point are down to the right unit now and for the future
  3. Numbers with digits to the left of the decimal point are up to the right unit now and for the future
  4. What rounding is appropriate now and for the future

Check data is minimized
Main Success Scenario:
  1. "Check Only Needed Data Exists in DB"
  2. "Check Data Retention Rules"

Check UniqueId
Note:
  -Invisible characters (due to not printable to screen or have no length) are not good in a Unique ID because you do not know what character they are, a human looking at them cannot understand what they are, and a human may not manually copy them correctly when pasting them somewhere else.
Main Success Scenario:
  1. "Check all parts of composite Unique ID exist"
  2. "Confirm appropriate delimiters in composite Unique ID"
  3. Check Unique Id is unique
  4. Check Unique ID definition is reliable for the life of the system
  5. Understand the Unique ID value patterns
  6. Remove Unique ID values with patterns that are known to not be needed 
  
Check indexing
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Are all columns joined, filtered, distincted, grouped, ordered, and aggregated on (like Max, Min) included in one or more indexes
  2. Are columns in the index ordered by most used first
  3. Are columns in the index ordered by least number of values first and most values last
  4. Do the column collations provide the best sort
  
Check for unexpected content in values 
Main Success Scenario:
  1. "Understand characters allowed in values"
  2. "Understand values allowed"
  3. Check for NULL values
  4. "Check for spaces"
  5. Check for empty string values
  6. Check for string NULL values
  7. "Check for values other than 0-9 and A-Z"
  8. "Check for unexpected phrases in column values"
  9. "Apply knowledge of character set conversion"
  

Apply knowledge of character set conversion
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Apply map of characters with a larger character identifier in character set A to smaller character identifier in character set B (like UTF-8 to CP1252)
  
Understand characters allowed in values
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Understand character set used in each step of the data sytem
  2. Understand what characters are possible from the source system
  3. Understand what characters may cause issues 

Check time is tracked appropriately
Main Success Scenario:
  1. "Confirm table row update time can be understood"
  2. "Confirm table row & column (cell) update time can be understood"
  3. "Confirm common update event time can be understood"
    
Check for spaces
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Check for values with leading or trailing spaces
  2. Check for values with spaces in the middle of non-spaces
  3. Check for values with only spaces
