Check Data Quality
Pre-Conditions
  -Run "Check SQL Object Quality" use case before this one
  -Not checking how well data was migrated or comparing upstream data to downstream data
Main Success Scenario:
  1. "Check UniqueId"
  3. "Check for unexpected characters in column values"
  4. "Check for Dupes"
  5. "Check for Value Length = Column Specified Length"
  6. "Check for unexpected phrases in column values"
  7. "Check if same column in different table has different values"
  8. "Check time is tracked appropriately"
  9. "Check Only Needed Data Exists in DB"
  10. "Check Data Retention Rules"
  11. "Check for appropriate number precision & scale"

  
Check UniqueId
Note:
  -Invisible characters (due to not printable to screen or have no length) are not good in a Unique ID because you do not know what character they are, a human looking at them cannot understand what they are, and a human may not manually copy them correctly when pasting them somewhere else.
Main Success Scenario:
  1. "Check all parts of composite Unique ID exist"
  2. "Confirm appropriate delimiters in composite Unique ID"
  3. Check Unique Id is unique
  4. Check Unique ID definition is reliable for the life of the system
  5. xxx:fill
  
Check for unexpected characters in column values
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Check for NULL values
  2. Check for just space value
  3. Check for empty string values
  4. Check for values with spaces
  5. Check for values other than 0-9 and A-Z

Check time is tracked appropriately
Main Success Scenario:
  1. "Confirm table row update time can be understood"
  2. "Confirm table row & column (cell) update time can be understood"
  3. "Confirm common update event time can be understood"
  
Check for appropriate number precision & scale
Note:
  -Precision is the total count of digits allowed in the number
  -Scale is how small the units go. 
  -For Numeric and Decimal data types Precision - Scale is the count of digits to the left of the decimal point. 
Main Success Scenario:
  1. "Check for appropriate Time Precision"
  2. "Check for appropriate Money Precision"
  -. "Check for appropriate Money Scale"
  3. "Check for appropriate Integer Precision"
  4. "Check for appropriate Decimal Precision"
  5. "Check for appropriate Decimal Scale"
  -. xxx:fill
