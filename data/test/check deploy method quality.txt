Check Deploy Method Quality
Note:
  -Altering a definition of an existing object may maintain the object create date. If that is possible, keeping the initial create date is ideal for tracking changes. 
  -In development, new objects can be changed many times. If that object is new to the next enviroment to deploy to, that object needs to be created and not altered there. 
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Are existing object definitions alterted instead of re-created
  2. Are new objects created instead of altered
  x. "Check Time Attriutes"
  x. Is deploy being automated as much as possible
  x. Are any deploy tasks duplicated
  x. "Check Code Versioning"
  x. Is there a fast track deploy process
  x. "Check Deploy Method Usage"
  x. xxx:fill in
  
Check Time Attriutes
