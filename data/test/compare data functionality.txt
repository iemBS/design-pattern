Compare Data Functionality
Note: 
  -Data functionality takes into account how the data is used and looks at how it functions. This may be more detaild than the data object definition. For example, for data functionality it may be required than a column not be null, but the definiton of that column (aka data object definition) allows it to be null. 
  -Comparing Data Functionality between two environments, like TEST and PRD, for the same application is important to maximize the benefit of testing in the TEST environment. 
  -Comparing Data Functionality between two different applications that must use the same logic, allows the two applications to better align.
