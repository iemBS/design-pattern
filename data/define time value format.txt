Define Time Value Format
Pre-Conditions:
  -If upstream, this, and the dowstream system have a single timezone, that timezone is assumed to be the same. 
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Upstream systems use only one timezone 
  2. Time values coming in will NOT have timezone conversions  
  3. This system will use one timezone 
  4. Time values going out will NOT have timezone conversions 
  5. Downstream systems use only one timezone
  6. Define time value format as YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS
  7. Chosen timezone is the same as your current timezone 
  8. "Choose 12 or 24 Hr Clock"
Alternatives:
  1a. Upstream systems use more than one timezone, but our system will use one
    1a1. "Define Time Format with Timezone"
    1a2. Go to step 2a
  1b. Upstream systems use more than one timezone and our system will use more than one
    1b1. "Define Time Format with Timezone"
    1b2. Follow step 2, then go to step 3a
  2a. Time values coming in WILL have timezone conversions 
    2a1. Go to step 3
  3a. This system will use more than one timezone
    3a1. "Define Time Format with Timezone"
    3a2. Go to step 4
  4a. Time values going out WILL have timezone conversions 
    4a1. Go to step 5a
  5a. Downstream systems use more than one timezone 
    5a1. Gp to step 6e
  6a. Milliseconds are needed to discern between times 
    6a1. Define time value format as YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.XXX
  6b. Seconds are not needed to discern between times 
    6b1. Define time value format as YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:00
  6c. Minutes are not needed to discern between times 
    6c1. Define time value format as YYYY-MM-DDTHH:00:00
  6d. I am not used to the chosen single timezone, so I need to see the timezone
    6d1. "Define Time Format with Timezone"
  6e. Downstream systems will have more than one timezone, so I need to see the timezone
    6e1. "Define Time Format with Timezone"
    
    
Define Time Format with Timezone
Note:
  -https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime
  -reasons to have time values being timezone aware:
    -comparing time values
    -downstream consumers clearly see the timezone used
    -xxx:fill in
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Define time format as YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss+xx:xx
Alternatives:
  1a. Include timezone name in field name and exclude timezone from the time value
    1a1. xxx:fill in
  1b. Have a seperate field for timezone and exclude timezone from the time value
    1b1. xxx:fill in
    
    
Choose 12 or 24 Hr Clock
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Choose 24 hr lock to avoid the AM/PM designation
Alternatives:
  1a. Choose 12 clock because the team is used to that
    1a1. xxx:fill in
