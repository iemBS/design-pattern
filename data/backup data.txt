  2. "Define Record Filter"
  3. "Define Column Filter"
  4. "Define DB Backup Utility Filter"
  5. End


Define Record Filter
Note:
  -In relation DB this would be row filter
  -In graph DB this would be xxx
  -In document DB this would be xxx
Main Success Scenario:
  1. xxx:fill in 


Define Field Filter
Note:
  -In relation DB this would be column filters
  -In graph DB this would be xxx filters
  -In xxx
Main Success Scenario:
  1. xxx:fill in

Main Success Scenario:
  1. Full backup
  2. Backup data and log
  3. End
Alternatives:
  1a. Partial backup
    1a1. xxx
    1a2. go to step 2
 2a. Backup only data
   2a1. xxx
   2a2. go to step 3


Define Backup Frequency
Main Success Scenario:
  1. "Understand Data Change by Time"
  2. "Understand Data Structure Change by Time"
  3. "Define Backup Lifespan"


Understand DB Change by Time
Main Success Scenario:
  1. xxx:fill in 


Understand Data Structure Change by Time
Main Success Scenario:
  1. xxx:fill in 


Define Backup Lifespan
Main Success Scenario:
  1. "See Available Storage"
  2. "Cost Storage"
  3. "MTTR with DB Restore"
  4. "Staling Data"
  5. "Define Max Backup Count"
  6. Specify duration to keep each backup
  7. End


See Available Storage
Main Success Scenario:
  1. xxx:fill in 


Cost Storage
Main Success Scenario:
  1. xxx:fill in 


Define Max Backup Count
Main Success Scenario:
  1. "MTTR with DB Restore"
  2. "Staling Data"
  3. Specify max backup count at one time
  4. End


MTTR with DB Restore
Note:
  -MTTR (mean time to resolve) is the average time it takes to fully resolve a failure. This includes not only the time spent detecting the failure, diagnosing the problem, and repairing the issue, but also the time spent ensuring that the failure won't happen again.
Main Success Scenario:
  1. xxx:fill in 


Staling Data
Main Success Scenario:
  1. "Staling Data for Provider"
  2. "Staling Data for Consumer"
  3. End


Staling Data for Provider
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Cannot correctly update data
  2. Misrepresents data that is in the provider
  3. Duration to achieve the above stale states
  4. End


Staling Data for Consumer
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Data does not align with other data systems
  2. Data hurts their data
  3. Data no longer relevant
  4. Duration to achieve the above stale states
  5. End
