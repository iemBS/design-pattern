Define Data Security
Pre-Conditions:
  -Users only have access to Data software via the association of their network user with the Data software
  -Final security design must allow for network users to be identifiable from within the Data software to:
    -determine who is running a query that is using too many resources, runnning too long, or performing unwanted actions
  -See "Identify Network User when using RBAC" for making the network user identifiable within the Data software 
Main Success Scenario:
  x. "Define Grand Map"
  x. "Define Business Group"
  x. "Define Functional Role"
  x. "Define Access Role"
  x. "Define Data Location Security"
  x. "Define Network User to Access Role Relation"
  x. "Understand Searchability of Grand Map"
  x. "Understand Network User Security Changeability"

Identify Network User when using RBAC
Pre-Conditions:
  -TableB is just a table with structure like below. The same idea should work for non-relational DBs
  
    Create Table TableB
    (
      networkUserAlias varchar(20)
    )
Note:
  -TableA in the SQL code below represents one or more tables/frames/node types/etc that is the location of the actual data for the query. While TableB represents the network users that have access to the Data software. 
  -Filtering of TableB does not impact the one or more tables/frames/node types/etc that are represented by TableA
  -Logs for the data software note the queries that have run and the network user filter that is used. 
  -If someone notes a different alias than their own, we cannot police that. 
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Network functionality allows for the Network User to be identified on enty to the Data software and passes that info to the Data software where it is associated to any actions within the Data software
  2. The Network User Alias is associted to all of the users activities in the Data software.
Alternatives:
  1a. Data software access goes through an interface before reaching the data software that catches the Network User and passes it onto the Data software where it is associated with actions in the Data software
  1b. All queries written in the data software are run through a process within the Data softwere where Network User Alias specified with the query is associated to the query in the Data software
  1c. All queries must be written in a certain way in the Data software so that the Network User Alias is associated to the query within the Data software
  1d. All queries must have a table/frame/node type/etc that is filtered on a single Network User Alias
    1. See code below
      # TableA represents one or more tables/frames/node types/etc and TableB represents a single table/frame/node type/etc with a single networkUserAlias column/field that contains all Network Users that have been granted access to the Data software. 
      Select
        a.*
      From
        TableA a,TableB b
      Where
        b.networkUserAlias = 'ckent'
    

  
Define Grand Map
Note:
  -Has the following columns:
    -network user attributes
      -full name
      -email alias
      -network alias
    -Is Human: Defines if this is a human or a machine/service
    -Business Group
    -Functional Role
    -Access Role: Role in data software
Main Success Scenario:
  1. xxx:fill in
  2. "Define Business Group List"

Main Success Scenario:
  1. Define Business Group Name
  2. Describe Business Group
  3. Define the members of the Business Group that need data access
  
  
Define Business Group Member Tasks
Note:
  -These are the data tasks performed by the members of the Business Group
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Define the tasks performed by the Business Group member
  2. Define the Data objects accessed by the Business Group member
  

Define Functional Role List
Note: 
  -There can be one or more levels of Functional Roles, if that helps translate the Functional Role tasks to Access Role privileges, where Access Roles may use a hierarchy.
  -There can be one or more levels of Access Roles 
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Collect the list of tasks performed by all members of the Business Groups
  2. "Associate Tasks to Common Functional Roles"
  3. "Define Functional Role" for each Functional Role
Alternatives:
  2a. Use uncommon Functional Roles

Associate Tasks to Common Functional Roles
Main Success Scenario:
  1. xxx:fill in
  
  
Define Functional Role
Note:
  -If easier, you can think of functional roles as containing, one or more other Functional Roles. 
  -When listing the tasks, write them in a way that are business friendly but yet can be translated to privileges for Access Roles
Main Success Scenario:
  1. For each Functional Role, note the name
  2. For each Functional Role, describe the tasks it performs
  3. Define the members of the Functional Role
  
  
Define Access Role List
Pre-Conditions:
  -"Understand Privilege Inheritence in an Access Role Hierarchy"
Note:
  -This use case does not implement. It only designs the Access Roles.
  -Each network user will be mapped to a generic user inside of an Access Role.
  -Each Access Role is a role object in the data software
  -Each Access Role has a single user object that uses the same name
  -There can be one or more levels of Access Roles. This allows for inheritance of privileges, which reduces the number of Access Roles that need to be created
  -Review RBAC
    -https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control
    -https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/authentication-access/database-level-roles?view=sql-server-ver15
    -https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/security-access-control-overview.html
Question:
  -How will the data objects accessed in the Data software, contribute to the design of the Access Role hierarchy?
Main Success Scenario:
  1. "Translate Functional Role tasks to Access Role privileges"
  2. "Review Common Access Role Hierarchies"
  3. Define a hierarchy of Access Roles that minimizes Access Role count  
  4. "Define Access Role to Data Object Relation"
  5. "Define Access Role" for each Access Role
  6. "Define Administrative Access Role" for each administrative Access Role

Main Success Scenario:
  1. xxx:fill in
  
  
Define Access Role to Data Object Relation
Note:
  -Access Role privileges granted at schema level 
  -Higher Access Roles in the Access Role hierarchy will be limited to a schema or not, depending on the security model that best fits the Data software users and management.
  -When estimating the number of Access Role, Schema Level Privilege, and Data Object combinations; factor in that a parent Access Role will inherit the privileges of one or more child Access Roles. 
Question:
  -Should a custom Access Role focus on one schema?
  -Should all custom Access Roles focus on one schema?
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Estimate the number of Access Role, Schema Level Privilege, and Data Object combinations
Alternatives:
  1a. Network User needs to access data from more than one schema
    1a1. Network User associated to more than one Access Role
  
 
Define Access Role
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Note the Access Role name
  2. Define privileges on the Access Role
  3. Define an Access User object that goes into the Access Role
  
  
Define Administrative Access Role
Note:
  -These roles are used for the management of the Data software and not born from a Functional Role
  -These are not built-in Access Role, but they do pass on privieges to built-in Access Roles
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Note the Access Role name
  2. Define privileges on the Access Role
  3. Define a hierarchy of administrative Access Roles that inherites from the other custom roles and pass on privileges to built-in Access Roles
