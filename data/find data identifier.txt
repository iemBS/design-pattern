Find Data Identifier
Note:
  -Field cardinality is the count of unique values in that field
  -Cardinality of field used in a join is size comparison of the count in one data set to another. If a value is joined on and the value in the left set can exist more than once when joined to the right set, then the left side is said to have a count of meny. If the count is only one and that is true for all values, then the count is 1. Same idea works for the set on the right.
