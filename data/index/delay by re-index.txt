  -Index may be updated first in the session that caused the re-index to update and then in the database in general.
Main Success Scenario:
  1. "Delay by Index Item Value Change"
  2. "Delay by Index Item Re-Positioning"
  3. End 
Alternatives:
  1a. index item deleted
    1a1. "Delay by Index Item Deletion"
    1a2. go to step 2
  1b. index item added
    1b1. "Delay by Index Item Addition"
    1b2. go to step 3

    
Delay by Index Item Value Change
Main Success Scenario:
  1. xxx:fill in 
    

Delay by Index Item Re-Positioning
Note:
  -Defining indexes that will not have their values updated, will eliminate index item re-positioning due to updates
  -Never deleting records, will eliminate index item re-positioning due to hard deletes
  -Never inserting records, will eliminate index item re-positioning due to inserts
  -Inserting new index items only at the end of an index, eliminates index item re-positining due to additions 
    -Only possible if ordering defined for the index sees all new index items as having a greater value
  -Duration of index item postition change depends on 
    -how many index items are changing position
    -index item data structure in storage
    -hardware and network attributes where the index items are stored
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Re-positioning of index item due to change of value within another item
  2. End
Alternatives:
  1a. Re-positioning of index item due to change of value within another index item
    1a1. go to step 2
  1b. Re-positioning of index item due to removal of another index item
    1b1. go to step 2
    

Delay by Index Item Deletion
Main Success Scenario:
  1. xxx:fill in 


Delay by Index Item Addition
Main Success Scenario:
  1. xxx:fill in 


Delay by Index Item Length
Note:
  -The larger the index item values, the more data that needs to be moved for each index item during a re-positioning
Main Success Scenario:
  1. xxx:fill in 


Delay by Index Item Order
Note:
  -The more updates to the values that make up the index item, the more likely the index item will change position
  -If an index is composite, the more value updates to the 1st part, the more likely the index item will change position. Value updates to the 2nd part, will mean it is less likely to change position or the position change will be shorter. This likeliness of a position change and the shortness of the position change reduces as you change the 3rd, 4th, etc part of the index item.
Main Success Scenario:
  1. xxx:Fill in
