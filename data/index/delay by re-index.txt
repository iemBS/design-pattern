  -Index may be updated first in the session that caused the re-index to update and then in the database in general.
Main Success Scenario:
  1. "Delay by Index Item Value Change"
  2. "Delay by Index Item Re-Positioning"
  3. End 
Alternatives:
  1a. index item deleted
    1a1. "Delay by Index Item Deletion"
    1a2. go to step 2
  1b. index item added
    1b1. "Delay by Index Item Addition"
    1b2. go to step 3

    
Delay by Index Item Value Change
Main Success Scenario:
  1. xxx:fill in 
    

Delay by Index Item Re-Positioning
Note:
  -Defining indexes that will not have their values updated, will eliminate index item re-positioning due to updates
  -Never deleting records, will eliminate index item re-positioning due to hard deletes
  -Never inserting records, will eliminate index item re-positioning due to inserts
  -Inserting new index items only at the end of an index, eliminates index item re-positining due to additions 
    -Only possible if ordering defined for the index sees all new index items as having a greater value
  -Duration of index item postition change depends on 
    -how many index items are changing position
    -index item data structure in storage
    -hardware and network attributes where the index items are stored
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Re-positioning of index item due to change of value within another item
  2. End
Alternatives:
  1a. Re-positioning of index item due to change of value within another index item
    1a1. go to step 2
  1b. Re-positioning of index item due to removal of another index item
    1b1. go to step 2
