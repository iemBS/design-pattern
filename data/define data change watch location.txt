Define Data Change Watch Location
Note:
  -Change can be flagged at any level
  -Using the levels in the data system, if any data change at the lower level is rolled up, then the higher level uses the latest change at the lower level to flag a change at the upper level.
    -If any changes are to be ignored at the lower levels, be sure to carry that up to the higher level change flags
