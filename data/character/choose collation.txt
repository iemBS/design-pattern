  -Collation refers to a set of rules and conventions that dictate how character data is compared and sorted, playing a crucial role in determining the order in which data is retrieved from the database and how various string operations, such as searching and filtering, are performed. 
  -Collation is closely intertwined with character sets, defining how characters within a specific character set are ordered. To ensure consistent results, itâ€™s important to select compatible collations for your chosen character sets. 
  -Incompatibilities between character sets and collations can lead to unexpected sorting and comparison outcomes, which could lead to issues in database operations and application functionality. 
  -One or more collations can be associated to each character set
  -Collation defines the sort that is used by an index
  -If a collation is specified on-the-fly that does not match the collation that the index is based on, then the index will not be used during a filter, sort, join, or aggregation. 
  -If a collation is changed, the indices that use it will need to be rebuilt.
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Case of letter characters searched for may not match the letter case in the searched data  
  2. xxx
Alternatives:
  1a. Case of letter characters searched for will always match the letter case in the searched data  
    1a1. Use a case sensitive collation
    1a2. go to step 
  xa. Search performance takes priority over sort performance
    xa1. Use xxx
