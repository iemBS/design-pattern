Unicode,UTF-8,Unicode Transformation Format – 8 bit,Each character is one to four 8-bit code units. Each 8-bit code unit is a byte. Primary character set used on internet.,8 bits / 1 byte,1-4,,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8; unicode.org/faq/utf_bom.html#UTF8; ,
Unicode,UTF-16,Unicode Transformation Format – 16 bit,Each character is one or two 16-bit code units. Not really used. Characters that are preceded by the character defined by the 0xC2 UTF-16 base 16 character identifier when the UTF-8 base 16 character identifiers are decomposed to UTF-16 base 16 character identifiers. Seeing the 0xC2 UTF-16 base 16 character identifier in data using the UTF-16 character set where it is not expected is a sign that UTF-8 to UTF-16 decomposition has taken place.,16 bits / 2 bytes,1-2,,unicode.org/faq/utf_bom.html#UTF16-3,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-16;  unicode.org/faq/utf_bom.html#UTF16; ,
