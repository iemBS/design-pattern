Main Success Scenario:
  1. xxx:fill in 


Get Performance Tunning Points
Main Success Scenario:
  1. xxx:fill in 


Get Value Characters
Note:
  -This gets the distinct list of characters found in any of the values in the data.
Main Success Scenario:
  1. xxx:fill in 


Get Data Config
Main Success Scenario:
  1. "Get Server Config"
  2. xxx:fill in 
  3. "Get Field Config"


Get Server Config
  1. Get configured character set
  2. xxx:fill in

  4. Determine if field has picklist values


Get Activity Log
Main Success Scenario:
  1. xxx:fill in 


See Activity Times
Main Success Scenario:
  1. "See Insert Activity Times"
  2. "See Update Activity Times"
  3. "See Delete Activity Times"
  x. End


See Insert Activity Times
Main Success Scenario:
  1. See if insert times exist
  2. See insert time queryability
  3. See insert volume over time
  4. "See Change Volume Per Time Unit"


See Update Activity Times
Main Success Scenario:
  1. See if update times exist 
  2. See update time queryability
  3. See update volume over time
  4. "See Change Volume Per Time Unit"


See Delete Activity Times
Main Success Scenario:
  1. See if delete times exist
  2. See delete time queryability
  3. See delete volume over time
  4. "See Change Volume Per Time Unit"


See Change Volume Per Time Unit
Note:
  -Volume could be measured in count, byte, or percent
  -Max is needed because you need to see the max amount of changes that can be done in the time period. 
  -Knowing the max amount of changes that can be done in a time period, can factor into the quality of time based unique identifiers or processes that function at a slower speed. 
Pre-Condition:
  -Specify if change is insert, update, or delete
Main Success Scenario:
  1. See max volume of changes per week
  2. See max volume of changes per day
  3. See max volume of changes per hour
  4. See max volume of changes per minute
