Find Data Identifier
Note:
  -Field cardinality is the count of unique values in that field
  -Cardinality of field used in a join is size comparison of the count in one data set to another. If a value is joined on and the value in the left set can exist more than once when joined to the right set, then the left side is said to have a count of meny. If the count is only one and that is true for all values, then the count is 1. Same idea works for the set on the right.

  -Examples of software that can auto change an ID
    -Software cannot handle the characters in the ID
    -ID is numeric and has leading zeroes. Excel drops the leading zeroes on a numeric ID. 
Main Success Scenario:
  1.Use source data identifier 
  2.ID NOT expire 
  3.ID NOT reused
  4.ID ranges do NOT need to be identifiable 
  5.ID NOT dependent on software development stage environment 
  6.ID has size limit (volume, length)
  7."Find Data Cardinality"
  8. ID not auto changed by software

Alternatives:
  1a. Use a common data identifier 
    1a1. "Use Common Data Identifier"
    1a2. Go to step 2
  1b. auto generate data identifier 
    1b1. "Auto Generate Data Identifier"
    1b2. Go to step 2
