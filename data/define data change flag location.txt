Define Data Change Flag Location
Note:
  -Data change watch location will be equal to or less than the data change flag location. For example, if I want to know there is a row change, I can watch for changes at the column level and flag a change at the row level. 
  -This indicates not only what level the data change is flagged at, but it also notes where the data change flag is stored.
