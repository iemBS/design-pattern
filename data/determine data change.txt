  1b. Current, Previous, or Deleted collection versions indicated
    1b1. "Indicated Current, Previous, or Deleted Collection Data"
    
   
Notified of Data Change w Modification Time
Pre-Condition:
  -Modification Time from the source needs to be compared with the last pull time from the source to pull the correct set of changes
  -Modification Time resolution is equal to or less than the data change frequency
Main Success Scenario:
  1. "Determine Data Change w Field Modification Time"
  2. End 
Alternatives:
  1a. Use record modification time instead
    1a1. "Determine Data Change w Record Modification Time"
    1a2. Go to step 2
  1b. Use collection modification time instead 
    1b1. "Determine Data Change w Collection Modification Time"
    
    
Notified of Data Change w Updated Flag
Pre-Condition:
  -Updated flag indicates an update has occurred since an activity or time
Main Success Scenario:
  1. "Determine Data Change w Field Updated Flag"
  2. End 
Alternatives:
  1a. Use record modification time instead
    1a1. "Determine Data Change w Record Updated Flag"
    1a2. Go to step 2
  1b. Use collection modification time instead 
    1b1. "Determine Data Change w Collection Updated Flag"
  
    
Compare Data
Pre-Condition:
  -Data change cannot be determined with a data change indicator in the source
Main Success Scenario:
  1. "Compare Data w Checksum"
  2. "Indicate Data Comparison Performed"
  3. End 
Alternatives:
  1a. Compare Data Values
    1a1. "Compare Data Values"
    1a2. Go to step 2
    
    
Indicate Data Comparison Performed
Note:
  -Indicating data that has not changed since being compared, will allow that data to be ignored during future comparisons
Main Success Scenario:
  1. xxx:fill in 
    
    
Determine Data Change w Field Updated Flag
Note:
  -Knowing what fields we want to know about changes in, will reduce the number of fields to check an updated flag for
Main Success Scenario:
  1. xxx:fill in 
  
  
Determine Data Change w Record Updated Flag


Determine Data Change w Collection Updated Flag
  
     
Determine Data Change w Field Modification Time
Pre-Condition:
  -Field Level Modification time exists, reliable, and has sufficient units
  -Record modification times are not sufficient 
  -Need to know field level changes
Note:
  -Knowing what fields we want to know about changes in, will reduce the number of fields to check a mod time on
Main Success Scenario:
  1. xxx:fill in 
  

Determine Data Change w Record Modification Time
Pre-Condition:
  -Record Level Modification time exists, reliable, and has sufficient units
  -Field modification times is not needed
  -Need to know record level changes
Main Success Scenario:
  1. xxx:fill in 
  
  
Determine Data Change w Collection Modification Time
Pre-Condition:
  -Collection Level Modification time exists, reliable, and has sufficient units
  -Record modification times is not needed
  -Need to know collection level changes
Main Success Scenario:
  1. xxx:fill in 
  
  
Compare Data Values
Main Success Scenario:
  1. "Compare Field Values / Record"
  2. End 
Alternatives:
  1a. Check at record level instead
    1a1. "Compare Record Values"
    1a2. Go to step 2
    
    
Compare Field Values / Record
Main Success Scenario:
  1.xxx:fill in 
  

Compare Record Values
Main Success Scenario:
  1.xxx:fill in 
  
    
Compare Data w Checksum
Pre-Condition:
  -Need to check data yourself because modification times do not exist or cannot be used
  -Checksum can be used on all data that will be compared
Note:
  -guidance @ 
    -https://www.nas.nasa.gov/hecc/support/kb/checking-file-integrity_243.html
    -https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum
  -Already having the checksums in the source, instead of calculating in your system, will save time and compute resources in your system
  -possible scenario:
    -source data collection has checksum value / record
    -source data collection pulled to your system
    -checksum value / record is kept on your system as a checksum list, even if the pulled collection is truncated on your system
    -before next pull from the source system, push the checksum list to the source system and call it list_A
    -take all the checksums from the source data collection and call it list_B and put an index on it
    -join list_A on list_B and delete list_B records where the checksums match
    -join list_B on the source data collection and pull over only the records with matching checksums
    -pull list_B from the source 
    -add the list_B checksums to the checksum value / record on your system
Main Success Scenario:
  1. "Compare Data w md5sum"
Alternatives:
  1a. xxx:fill in 
  
  
Compare Data w md5sum
Main Success Scenario:
  1. xxx:fill in
