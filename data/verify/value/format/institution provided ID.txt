Verify Institution Provided ID
Main Success Scenario:
  1. xxx:fill in
  
  
Apply Known Rules on ID
Note:
  -Use flags to indicate verification status with the known rules and with unknown rules as well
  -Since we need to indicate not checked, verified to be bad, and verified to be good; there needs to be three values for known rule verification and three values for a an unknown rule verification.
    -The lack of a check may be best indicated with a null value
    -options for field names
      -if you only need to know current validation status and assuming that unknown rules only checked if known rules are passed 
        -IsValid, where 
          -"1" = valid with known rules
          -"2" = valid with unknown rules
          -"-1" = invalid with known rules
          -"-2" = invalid with unknown rules 
      -if need to know if known and unknown rules are passed and unknown rules are checked even if known rules indicates invalid
        -IsValidWithKnownRules
          -1
          -0
        -IsValidWithUnknownRules
          -1
          -0
