  6. "Discuss Data with Data Owner" use case
  7. "Discuss Data with Data Users" use case


Discuss Data with Data Owner
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Find Targeted Data change frequency
  2. Find Targeted Data relationships
  3. Find Targeted Data patterns
  4. Find data issues
  5. Find potential data issues


Discuss Data with Data Users
Main Success Scenario:

  3. Find Expected Data patterns
  4. Find Expected issues
  5. Find potential data issues
  6. Find Desired Data change frequency
  7. Find Desired Data relationships
  8. Find Desired Data patterns


Define Story to tell
Preconditions:
  - Data is new to you
  - Need to translate this new data to visuals that can be understood by less technical people
Main Success Scenario:
  1. [xxx: need to fill in]


Define Question to Answer
Preconditions:
  - Data is not new to you
  - This question is new to you
Main Success Scenario:
  1. [xxx: need to fill in]


Use Chart Decision Tree
Note
  - Chart decision trees to use
      https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-pick-the-right-chart-type-or-graph-for-your-data
      https://medium.com/activewizards-machine-learning-company/how-to-choose-the-right-chart-type-infographic-86ca7c7fdf70
Preconditions: 
  - passed "Define Story to Tell" or "Define Question to Answer" use case
  - passed "Understand Data" use case
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Derive these chart decision tree attributes from what you have learned:
       -Present distribution (yes, no)
       -Visualize composition (yes, no)
       -Show relationship (yes, no)
       -Indicate Trend (yes, no)
       -Compare (yes, no) > if yes, Compare items or Through time
       -# of variables to have in chart
          -if 1, is variable ordered (yes, no)
          -if >1, are variable similiar (yes, no)
             -if no, are variables ordered (yes, no)
             -if yes, do variables have hierarchy (yes, no)
               -if no, are variables ordered (yes, no)
  2. Look at a chart decision tree to determine best possible charts to use
