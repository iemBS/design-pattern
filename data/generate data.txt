      -field data type
      -field nullability
      -relationships between collections
        -relationship cardinality
      -uniqueness of values in a field 
      -xxx
    -person
      -name part count
      -use of prefix or suffix
    -geography

    3a2. go to step 4
  3b. More than one email will be created per millisecond
    3b1. Use nanoseconds in time contribution (YYMMDD_HHMMSS_XXXXXX)
     3b2. go to step 4
