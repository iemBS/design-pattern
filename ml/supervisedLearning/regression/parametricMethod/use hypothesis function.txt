Use Hypothesis Function 
Preconditions:
  - This function describes line that best fits plot of real data. 
  - x0, x1, ... xn are features
  - features ideally have measurement data
  - @0, @1, ... @n like the slope in the line equation define the relationship between a feature and y.
  - @n = slope/gradient of feature n
  - @n is the xn & y relationship 
  - h(x) = predicted y from a hypothesis
  - n = # of features - 1
  - xn is a xn-coordinate, not a x-coordinate
  - x0 = 1
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Put line equation in ML terms
       y = @1*x1 + @0
  2. Extend line equation to allow more features
       h(x) = @0 + @1*x1 + @n*xn 
  3. Need to create a cost function for this hypothesis function. 
  4. Cost function used to determine the @n values to use in hypothesis function.
