When to use Principal Component Analysis
Preconditions: 
  - This is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components. 
  - This can be used in Supervised Learning as well. 
Main Success Scenario: 
  1. Use on high dimensional data before using Support Vector Clustering algorithm.
