When to use Reinforcement Learning (RL)
Preconditions: 
  - This is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward. 
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Focus on performance.
  2. Focus is finding a balance between exploration (of uncharted territory) and exploitation (of current knowledge)
  2. Labelled input/output pairs need not be presented
  3. Sub-optimal actions need not be explicitly corrected.
