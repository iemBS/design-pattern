When to use a Regression Type Model
Preconditions:
  - [need to explain what Y is]
  - The type of the regression model depends on the type of the distribution of Y
  - Y is continuous and approximately normal
Main Success Scenario
  1. Use linear regression model
Alternatives:
  1a. Y is dichotomous
    1a1. Use logistic regression
  1b. Y is Poisson or multinomial
     1b1. Use log-linear analysis
  1c. Time-to-event data is in the presence of censored cases (survival-type)
    1c1. Use Cox regression
