Choose Linear Regression Selection Method
  Note: borrowed from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3049417/#!po=31.0000
Preconditions:
  - There are various selection methods for linear regression modeling in order to specify how independent variables are entered into the analysis
  - By using different methods, a variety of regression models from the same set of variables could be constructed. 
  - All variables must pass the tolerance criterion to be entered in the equation, regardless of the entry method specified.
  - A variable is not entered if it would cause the tolerance of another variable already in the model to drop below the tolerance criterion.
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Forward variable selection
Alternatives:
  1a. Backward variable elimination
  1b. Stepwise variable entry and removal
  
  
Forward variable selection:
enters the variables in the block one at a time based on entry criteria. 

Backward variable elimination: 
enters all of the variables in the block in a single step and then removes them one at a time based on removal criteria. 

Stepwise variable entry and removal: 
examines the variables in the block at each step for entry or removal.
