-Use cases are used to discover requirements rather than to document them
-Use cases are not used to discover all requirements. Only the behavioral requirements

Concepts that apply to each setence in a use case and the use case as a whole
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-Scope: What is readlly the system under discussion (SuD)?
-Primary actor: Who has the goal?
-Level: How high or low level is that goal?


Simple Text Use Case parts
-----------------------------
-Actor: Anyone or anything  with behavior
-Primary actor: The stakeholder who or which initiates an interaction wtih the SuD to achieve a goal.
-Scope: Identifies the system that we are discussing
-Precondition: What must be true before the use case runs?
-Guarantee: What must be true after the use case runs?
-Main Success Scenario: A case in which nothing goes wrong.
-Alternatives/Extensions: What can happen differently during that scenario?


The Use Case form of writing can be used in these situations
-------------------------------------------------------------
-To describe a business's work process
-The focus discussion about upcoming software system requirements, but not to be the requirements description
-To be the functionality requirements for a system
-To document the design of the system
-To be written in a small, close-knit group, or in a large or distributed group


Use Cases as a Project Linking Structure
------------------------------------------
-Use cases connect many other requirements details
-Use cases provide a scaffolding that connects info in different parts of the reqs
-Use cases help crosslink user profile info, business rules, and data format reqs
-Outside the reqs doc, use cases help structure project planning info such as
  -release dates
  -teams
  -priorities
  -development status
-Use cases help the design team track certain results
  -Particularly the design of the user interface and system tests
-These requirements are connected to use cases
  -Data Formats
  -I/O Protocols
  -Performance Reqs
  -UI Reqs
  -UI Design
  -Business Rules
-Some consider use cases to be the central element of the project' dev process
  

Use Case Precision that is Needed and How to Tighten It
--------------------------------------------------------
-Write Usage Narrative to warm up
-Define actors and goals
-Define Main Success Scenario
-Write Failure Conditions 
-Write Failure Handling
