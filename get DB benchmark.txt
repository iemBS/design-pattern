Get SQL DB Benchmarks
Note: 
  - Guidance from http://www.tpc.org/
Preconditions:
  - Transaction Processing Performance Council = TPC
  - TPC-H benchmark used for SQL DBs
  - TPC-H called a decision support system benchmark
  - TPC-H is good OLAP test
  - TPC-C assumes little RAM and relies heavily on disk IO
  - TPC-C benchmark is obsolete
  - TPC-E assumes large amount of RAM & CPU and not rely as much on disk IO
  - TPC-E is a modern OLTP application that models a stock brokerage and uses a much more sophisticated simulated world driven by fluctuating stock prices and emulates a chaotic 'outside world' of customers placing market orders, limit orders and stop-limit orders
  - TPC-E is good OLTP test
Main Success Scenario:
  1. [xxx: need to fill in]


Get NoSQL DB Benchmarks
Note: 
  - Guidance from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YCSB
  - Guidance from https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/performance-testing-mongodb-30-part-1-throughput-improvements-measured-ycsb
Preconditions:
  - Yahoo! Cloud Serving Benchmark = YCSB
  - YCSB is an open-source spec and program suite for evaluating retrieval and maintenance capabilities of computer programs
  - YCSB often used to compare relative performance of NoSQL DB Mngmt Systems 
  - YCSB called a Big Data Benchmark
  - For "Throughput", larger is better
  - For "Latency", lower is better
  - For "Providing Sufficient Client Capacity", larger or unchanging is better
Main Success Scenario:
  1. Test Throughput (operations/second) for workload w 100% writes
  2. Test Throughput (operations/second) for workload w 95% reads, 5% writes
  3. Test Throughput (operations/second) for workload w 50% reads, 50% writes
  4. Latency (milliseconds) for workload w 95% reads, 5% writes
  5. Latency (milliseconds) for workload w 50% reads, 50% writes
  6. Providing Sufficient Client Capacity (operations/second) for workload w 1 thread,50% reads, 50% writes
  7. Providing Sufficient Client Capacity (operations/second) for workload w 5 threads,50% reads, 50% writes
  8. Providing Sufficient Client Capacity (operations/second) for workload w 10 threads,50% reads, 50% writes
  9. Providing Sufficient Client Capacity (operations/second) for workload w 50 threads,50% reads, 50% writes
  10. Providing Sufficient Client Capacity (operations/second) for workload w 100 thread,50% reads, 50% writes
